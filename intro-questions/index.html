        <h1>Ella Jang Introductory Questions</h1>
        
        <p><b>Name, Major, Year in School:</b> <br>Ella Jang, Junior, Communication Design major with a minor in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</p>

        <p><b>Background and Why I’m Taking This Class:</b> <br>I’ve always been interested in UI/UX design and HCI. I chose to take this class not only because it’s a requirement for the Communication Design major, but also because I believe the skills I gain here will directly support my future career goals as a UI/UX designer.</p>

        <p><b>Experience with Coding:</b> <br>I don’t have much experience with coding in general. I took CSE 131 during my freshman year, which gave me a basic introduction to programming, but I’m still relatively new to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    
        <p><b>One Thing I Hope to Learn in This Class:</b> <br>I hope to become more familiar with different coding languages and learn how to build simple websites or interfaces from scratch. I’d like to feel more confident working in a digital development environment.</p>
    
        <p><b>One Way Designing for Screen is Different from Designing for Paper:</b> <br>Designing for screens is more complex in terms of layout flexibility. However, digital design can also make consistency easier to maintain through reusable components, unlike print where everything must be manually adjusted.</p>
   
        <p><b>A Website That Exemplifies Effective Design:</b> https://www.apple.com <br>I think Apple’s website is a great example of clean, minimal design with strong visual hierarchy. The use of whitespace, typography, and product images guides the viewer’s attention while maintaining a consistent brand aesthetic.</p>

        <p><b>A Website That Exemplifies Effective Communication:</b> https://www.nytimes.com <br>I think The New York Times site is well-structured and organizes complex information in an accessible way. It uses headlines, subheadings, and visual elements effectively to help readers quickly find the content they are looking for.</p>

        <p><b>A Website That Works Well:</b> https://www.canva.com <br>I think Canva works exceptionally well because it combines powerful design tools with an user-friendly interface. Even users with no design background can easily create professional looking visuals.</p>
