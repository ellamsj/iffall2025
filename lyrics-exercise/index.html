            <p> 
                <span class = subtitle>[Verse 1]</span>
                <br> I wanna come home to roses
                <br> And dirty little notes on Post-its
                <br> And when my hair starts turning gray
                <br> He'll say I'm like a fine wine, better with age
            </p>

            <br>

            <p> 
                <span class = subtitle>[Verse 2]</span>
                <br> I guess I learned it from my parents
                <br> That true love starts with friendship
                <br> A kiss on the forehead, a date night
                <br> Fake an apology after a fight
            </p>

            <br>

            <p> 
                <span class = subtitle>[Chorus]</span>
                <br> I need a man who's patient and kind
                <br> Gets out of the car and holds the door
                <br> I wanna slow dance in the living room like
                <br> We're 18 at senior prom and grow
                <br> Old with someone who makes me feel young
                <br> I need a man who loves me like
                <br> My father loves my mom
            </p>

            <br>

            <p> 
                <span class = subtitle>[Verse 3]</span>
                <br> I want a road trip in the summers
                <br> I wanna make fun of each other
                <br> I wanna rock out to Billy Joel
                <br> And flip our kids off when they call us old
                <br> He'll accidentally burn our dinner
                <br> And let me be the scrabble winner
                <br> And when my body changes shapes
                <br> He'll say, "Oh my God, you look hot today"
            </p>

            <br>

            <p> 
                <span class = subtitle>[Chorus]</span>
                <br> I need a man who's patient and kind
                <br> Gets out of the car and holds the door
                <br> I wanna slow dance in the living room like
                <br> We're 18 at senior prom and grow
                <br> Old with someone who makes me feel young
                <br> I need a man who loves me like
                <br> My father loves my mom
            </p>

            <br>

            <p> 
                <span class = subtitle>[Bridge]</span>
                <br> And if he lives up to my father
                <br> Maybe he could teach our daughter
                <br> What it takes to love a queen
                <br> She should know she's royalty
            </p>

            <br>

            <p> 
                <span class = subtitle>[Chorus]</span>
                <br> I need a man who's patient and kind
                <br> Gets out of the car and holds the door
                <br> I wanna slow dance in the living room like
                <br> We're 18 at senior prom and grow
                <br> Old with someone who makes me feel young
                <br> I need a man who loves me like
                <br> My father loves my mom

            <br>

            <p> 
                <span class = subtitle>[Outro]</span>
                <br> I need a man who loves me like
                <br> My father loves my mom
