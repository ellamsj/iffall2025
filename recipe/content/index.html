                offers a visually polished and user-friendly recipe layout with a strong emphasis on structure and clarity. The site makes excellent use of hierarchy through clear headings, step numbering, and high-quality imagery that supports each instruction. A floating recipe card enhances usability by keeping key information accessible while scrolling. From a UX standpoint, the inclusion of pro tips, ingredient notes, and storage advice helps users feel more confident in their baking.

                offers a clear and practical recipe layout that works well for both beginners and experienced bakers. The use of bold headings, step images, and well-structured content makes it easy to follow. It also does a great job of explaining the “why” behind each step, which helps build trust and confidence. However, the page layout feels a bit crowded, with all the content pushed to the right side and surrounded by ads and sidebars. This can make it harder to read and slightly overwhelming. Adding more white space or a simplified view could improve the overall user experience.

                <span class="numbered-list">3. <a href="https://www.cupcakeproject.com/butterscotch-sauce/"> Cupcake Project</a> </span>
                uses a traditional blog layout with a clear recipe block and helpful additions like FAQs and user questions. The friendly tone and practical baking tips make it approachable for home bakers. However, the overall layout could be improved: the main image is quite large, which pushes content down and makes it harder to view everything at once. The steps are also not numbered, which can be confusing for beginners trying to follow along. On the positive side, embedded links throughout the post are useful, allowing users to easily explore specific techniques or tools in more detail. More consistent spacing and visual organization would improve readability, especially on smaller screens.

                ’s design is minimalist and distraction free, with a strong focus on usability. Menus are simple, typography is clean, and calls to action are clear and consistent. For recipe design, emulating this means minimizing visual clutter (ads, unrelated links), keeping formatting consistent, and making key actions prominent (ex. “print recipe,” “save to favorites).

                <span class="numbered-list">2. <a href="https://www.notion.com/"> Notion</a></span>
                combines flexibility and structure: clean grids, collapsible sections, and modular content blocks. Users can expand or collapse what they need, reducing overload. Translating this to recipe UI could mean using collapsible instruction steps, tooltips or expandable sections.
                <br>
                <span class="numbered-list">3. <a href="https://medium.com/"> Medium</a></span>
                Medium excels in content readability through clean typography, generous white space, and a distraction-free interface. Articles are broken up with subheadings, callouts, and high-contrast pull quotes. For recipe content, I can incorporate generous spacing, bold headings, and minimal styling to help users stay focused while cooking.
